# Session Five: Sketch!

May 3, 2017 - DePaul Entrepreneurship Center

**Instructor** - Kara

**TAs** - Jerliyah, Ryan, Nithun, Justin, Oscar

## Session Goal:
To determine the data resources needed to build the app. We will use our wireframes, user flows, and other knowledge, to sketch out our database and understand how data is stored.

## Session Schedule:

### Welcome:
  - Confirm TA groups!
  - Review:
    - HTML/CSS
      - HTML Syntax:
      ```
      <startElement attribute="value"> content </endElement>
      ```
      - CSS Syntax:

      HTML: <p id="idname">
      CSS:  #idname {
            }
      ```
      - Font Use

### Intro to Data:
  - Learn about Data Types
    - Strings, Integers, Floats, Boolean, Array, Hash/object
  - Activity: From your wireframes and user flows, review all data being input and output. For those inputs and outputs, note what data types would need to be used.

### Intro to Javascript:
  - Learn about the Console Log
  - Learn about Variables
  - Intro to Javascript Syntax

### Intro to Schemas:

## Homework:
- [ ] In a `sketch.md` file, write examples of the following concepts/data types we learned
  - String, Boolean, Integer, Float, Array, Object Hash, data vs. information, database relationships (belongs-to, has-many, one-to-one, many-to-many)
- [ ] Sketch a detailed schema of your apps data. Use [this DB Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c9sgq16us36K1bygqDWLI8V_7pW-Odt0qeJW3DBwltg/edit?usp=sharing)
- [ ] Continue to wireframe and build HTML pages. Ensure that all work is uploaded to github.
