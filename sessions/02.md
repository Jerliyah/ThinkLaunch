# Session Two: Storify!
April 11, 2017 - DePaul Entrepreneurship Center

**Instructor** - Kara

**TAs** - Asha, Eve, Jerliyah, Ryan, Nithun, Justin

## Session Goal:
To gather, analyze and summarize audience research to create features for your app through User Flows, User Stories, and Storyboarding.

## Session Schedule:
### Welcome
  - Review - Design Challenge Statements, Git & Github
    - [ ] Confirm you are comfortable with git workflow process (status, add, commit, push, pull)
    - [ ] Confirm you've created and know how to access (with your command line AND code editor) a ThinkLaunch Course folder on your desktop, with your project repository saved in that folder.

### Intro to User Research
  - Intro to Users!
  - Activity: Using your Idea, make an [Audience Map](http://www.designkit.org/methods/11).
    - in a _storify.md_ file:
    - [ ] List at least 4 groups directly impacted by your idea
    - [ ] List at least 4 groups peripherally related, or connected to direct audience groups
    - [ ] Of all groups listed, determine who are your fans? who are your critics? (EXTRA CREDIT if you list WHY they may be fans/critics)
    
  - Actvity: Build [Personas](resources/persona-core-poster.pdf)
    - [ ] Create _at least_ three persona posters based on the above persona-core-poster.pdf and LINK to the images on your _storify.md_ file
      - process:
        - Create your Persona images (reccomending you use powerpoint, or google slides)
        - Save each image within your project repository
        - link to the image in your _storify.md_ file by using markdown: `![the text description of my image](imagefile.jpg)`

### Intro to Features & User Stories
  - Intro to Features & User Stories
    - **Feature**: An Activity someone can do using your idea. _i.e. signup, search, buy, upload, add, ask, play_
    - **User Story**: a 3-part statement that drives an implementation. written in the format _as a `user`, I want to `action` sto that `desired goal`_
  - Intro to User Flow
    - From persona's perspective, create steps from decision to engage with idea to problem solved.
  - Activity: Brainstorm Features
    - [ ] write 2-5 features that your idea provides
  - Activity: [Write 3-5 User Stories per feature](http://bit.ly/UserStoryWorksheet)
    - [ ] for each of the features, write a user story from each of your persona's perspectives.
  
#### Break

### Documentation and Prep for Research
  - Review Code Editors
    - [ ] confirm you are comfortable opening your project repository in your code editor, creating files, and editing files to be commited through the command line with git. 
  - Activity: Update your repository's ReadME using the [sample ReadME](resources/sample-readme.md)
    - [ ] Review your README.md file and if you need a template, use the above!

## Homework:
  - [ ] Choose an [Inspiration research method](http://www.designkit.org/methods#filter) from the Design Thinking Toolkit to gather feedback on your assumtions about your users based on the audience map, personas, and user stories you've generated.
  - [ ] Document a User flow for each feature, from the perspective of your top 3 User group personas. (This list will prepare us for Session 3!)
    - process:
      - When thinking about the features you want to provide via your idea, what steps are being taken by each persona to reach the expected goals? make an enumerated list, be as detailed as possible. NOTE: This is different than a user story!
